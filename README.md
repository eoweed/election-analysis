### Election Audit Summary

how can this be used for any election
2 examples of how this script can be modified for other elections

#### The data provided by the Colorado Board of Elections was analyzed using a python script to show election results by county and by candidate. This python script could also be used for any other election as long as the data set has entries for candidates and counties as well. 

#### However, the python script could also be modified to analyze data sets from other elections that have different parameters. For example, if we wanted to analyze data from the presidental election in the U.S. then the candidate options would need to be the presidential candidates. In addition, the python script could be changed to analyze votes by state instead of county, or analyze votes based on political party
